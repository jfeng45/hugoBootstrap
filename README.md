# Bootstrap theme for "Software Craftsman" site 

This is my blog site. I use Hugo with [Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/Xzya/hugo-bootstrap). I did some enhancement to the Bootstrap theme to provide additional functionalities I needed. The following is them: 

* Added support for user comments with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
* Added short title when displaying "recent posts".
* Fixed the problem with "recent posts", so it only displays real(regular) pages in "recent posts"
* Added support for Canonical Url for Google search
* Added "description" meta tag for Google search, currently it only has "twitter:description" and "og:description"
* Added support for Chinese language
* Fixed the problem of footer not sticking at the bottom when displaying Chinese content
* Added special layout for the contents in "project" folder under "content"
* Added new layout support for "Home" ( introduction) page 

I like the Bootstrp theme because it is clean and concise and support multi-language, but it is missing some functionalities and 
has some minor problems need to be fixed before it can be used. If you think the above items might be help to you, 
you download and use it for your site. The blog site is ["Softare Craftsman"](https://jfeng45.github.io/en/)

You can use it as any other themes, just copy the folder "hugo-bootstrap" to your themes folder.
